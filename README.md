# fontTest
This program is a simple font display to get a feel of the various fonts' appearance.
The fonts are divided into categories:
- sans-serif
- serif
- monospaced
- irregular/ornate
- other (which includes foreign or technical fonts)

#Interface

The user has a limited selection of style (bold/italic) and size of the font.
The displayed text is editable.

The 'Sample' button displays an array of alphanumeric and punctuation characters.

The 'Unicode' button shows all Unicode characters from 0000 to 9999.

*Warning:* the Unicode feature is experimental:
- most fonts don't have a glyph for many Unicode characters;
- the first lines can get messy as some characters represent control codes.

#About this version

Developed on Windows 10 with Eclipse IDE and JavaSE-14.
